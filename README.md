Model-View-Controller (MVC) Tech Blog


## Description

This application uses Model view controller framework to create a Tech-blog.
Application is a full-stack web application, using modularization to log-in user.
This application is created using MySQL for the database to collect and poste data from user. Using handlebars for dynamic render.  
Server and routes are created to manage the interaction between the view and the model, data information is managed and updating the database.

Create a full stack application, using controllers, server and config.
Application that allows the user input the information for specific tech topic, data is recorded and posted. User is able to manage the information updating, edit or deleting the post. 
The application uses JavaScript, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, handlebars and environmental variables. 
On the back end is using NodeJS and server routing for application.

Create a full stack application, user can be able to log in, log out, or log -up if is a new user.
Also, users can create content and share experience or new information thru a front-end website which data and records are being processed on the back end and database.
Modularization allows us to manage multiple sections of the application while having communication through the routers.
This program shows the use of NodeJS as backend JavaScript to be able to execute the JavaScript code and use of MySQL to create and manage information from database and corresponding tables. 
Connection to the application, use schema.sql and seeds.sql for database, tables and data.

With this application I learned how to implement the model view controller framework in a full stack web application.
Use the handlebars for rendering dynamic HTML.
Use of helpers and pass data for application operation
Use of serialization of data
I learned the use of MySQL , Inquire and  NodeJS to write the server file using JavaScript.
Use of schema to create the tables, Use of primary keys.
Create a back-end application, set-up a server, MySQL and server route for Application.
